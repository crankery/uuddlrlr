# uuddlrlr

Uuddlrlr is just another joystick module for Eurorack.

This is a though hole implementation of the [CCTV Ouija](https://www.cctv.fm/product-page/ouija-eurorack-diy-kit) module. I had pretty much all the parts for this laying around (including the Chinese copy of the Omter joystick) so I decided to just lay it out and fool around with it.

This is not done. Please don't build it. If you're really smart and you see that I've done something really stuipd, I'd be pleased to hear from you. I am, after all, just copying somebody else's work here while I watch stupid stuff on YouTube.
